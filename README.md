# Introduction

This workflow will be used to analyze cell counts extracted from spinning disk - organoid microscopy data. The example file demonstrates how the input file should look like. The jupiter notebook is performed on this example file and shows the results.

## Requirements

A IDE to display jupiter notebooks (such as [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com)) or an online solution, is needed. Required packages can be installed with pip and are:

```ruby
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
```
