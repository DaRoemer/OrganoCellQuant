# Introduction

This workflow will be used to analyze cell counts extracted from spinning disk - organoid microscopy data. The example file demonstrates how the input file should look like. The jupiter notebook is performed on the experimental data and demonstrates and documents the analysis of this data.

## Requirements

A IDE to display jupiter notebooks (such as [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com)) or an online solution, is needed. Required packages can be installed with conda:

```ruby
conda env create -f OrganoCellQuantEnv.yml
```

## How to use

- Copy/download the repository on your device.
- Replace the *Example file* with your own data
- Change the name of the *Example file* in the first code block of the jupiter notebook.
- Run block by block
